% ECGAUG -- rhythmstrip_script
% Version 1.0
%  
% Loads QRST signals and fidicual points and puts data into correct format
% for then passing into the rhythmstrip() function which generates random,
% annotated rhythm strips.  Sections between %----% will likely 
% need to be modified based on your specific files and data structure.
%
% The script loops ('num_strips' times) to generate multiple rhythm strips 
% as needed.  Adjust Augparams between loop iterations to generate 
% additional diversity.
